-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It allows git to install the necessary files in a hidden directory (.git/) to make your project a repository and allow it to be uploaded to git and track commits.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different in that it gives you a clear indication of which file(s) you want to commit.
