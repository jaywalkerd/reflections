-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you have more than one contributor for the project or if you use multiple computers where it would be difficult to keep the project in sync without version control.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may make changes that could potentially be overridden if Git automatically stayed up to date with your remote.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are projects copied from some one else's Git.  Forks are typically used when you don't have permission to push commits to a project so you make a copy to your Git.

Clones are copies of projects that are made to your local machine.  A clone differs from a fork where it is saved locally, whereas a fork is saved online on your Git.

Branches are paths of a project.  They may be experimental, where new features are first tested, or they may be a master branch, which is typically a stable version.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you would know the point in which you last pulled a commit and know at which point you started modifying code.
